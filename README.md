Hence, the website looks as below:
<img src=./images/readme-example-grid-layout.JPG alt="grid layout result" width=400px>

### Z-index Property
Z-index has been used to adjust the items order in z-axis. In order to bring the image behind the text, the project description z-index has been set as 2 whilst the z-index of the project image is 1. The result can be seen below:
<img src=./images/readme-example-z-index.JPG alt="z-index layout result" width=400px>

### Clickable SVG
SVG icons have been used in order to make links more attractive and user friendly. Links have been attached to SVG element by following this code:
<img src=./images/readme-example-svg-code.JPG alt="SVG code example" width=400px>
So, the SVG icons look as shown below:
<img src=./images/readme-example-svg-layout.JPG alt="SVG layout result" width=400px>
